The situation: You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

Findings:
The purpose of this study is to identify the treatment of drug regimens according to the SCC tumors. Out of the drug regimens, Ketrapril had the highest tumor volume on average, whilst also having the highest median and variance of tumor volume. On the other hand, Capomulin and Ramicane had the most successful results, having the smallest tumors out of the all-drug regimens. 
 
The dataset had nearly even number of male and female mice for the experiment. 
 


The tumor plot showcased an interesting finding that shows the distribution of the tumor volume for each treatment group (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, Ceftamin). Capomulin and Ramicane had nearly identical box plot values with only a few measurements off from one another. The Infubinol and Ceftamin displayed different results presenting both drug regimen on the higher tumor volume by milliliters (mm).
 

The average tumor volume by weight for the Capomulin drug regimen describes the weight of the mouse by the average size of the tumor volume. From the scatter plot, the line illustrates the linear relationship between the two variables.
 

The final graph indicates that there is a relationship between the average tumor volume and the weight of the mouse by Capomulin.
 
Overall, the purpose of this research is to find the performance of Capomulin compared to other drug regimens. From the graphs and visualization above, Capomulin had performed the best results. However, Ramicane had similar box plot results to Capomulin indicating that Ramicane could prove to be a possible drug regimen alternative to Capomulin.
